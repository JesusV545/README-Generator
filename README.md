# README Generator
This application allows the user to create a simple README.md file using javascript and node.js!

## Purpose
In this project, the purpose was to use javascript alongside node.js to generate a READme.md file. This allows the user to use the terminal to run node.js and fill out a short questionnaire
to fill the README.md file. 

## How To Use
Once the code is loaded and ready for use, open the terminal and install the Inquirer npm. After that simply run the 'index.js' file. Once this is completed, you will be prompted to fill out the questions relating to your new project
